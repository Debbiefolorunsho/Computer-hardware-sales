## Tools And Technologies Used
- **Power BI:** This was the major tool used in this project. Power BI was used in coming up with the visualization and dashboards for the insights generated from this project. Power BI service, a component of Power BI was also utilized in creating a web link that allows interactivity and navigation with the report.
- **Power Query Editor:** This is an advanced feature of Power BI that allows transformation and cleaning to be carried out on a dataset. The Power Query Editor was used in carrying out transformations across different columns such as removing duplicates, removing blank rows, formatting columns, replacing values, etc.
- **Microsoft Excel:** This was the least used tool in the course of this project. Microsoft Excel was used at the start of the project to provide an understanding of the data structure, and to provide a guide on the steps to be carried out in transforming the data using the Power Query Editor.
